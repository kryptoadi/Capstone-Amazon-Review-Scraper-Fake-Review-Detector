# 📦 Amazon Review Scraper & Fake Review Detector

This project provides a complete pipeline to scrape product reviews from Amazon, process the data, and detect fake or AI-generated reviews using advanced machine learning and deep learning techniques.

## 🚀 Features

- Scrapes Amazon reviews using product ASINs  
- Sends real-time review data to Apache Kafka  
- Converts JSON to structured CSV  
- Trains ensemble models (Neural Network, XGBoost, Random Forest, and others)  
- Supports pseudo-labeling and class balancing  
- Visualizes results with IEEE-style plots  
- Detects suspicious review patterns using NLP and linguistic analysis

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- Text Processing: TF-IDF, sentence complexity, vocabulary diversity, etc.  
- Models Used:  
  - Multilayer Neural Network  
  - XGBoost Classifier  
  - Random Forest  
  - SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes (optional)  
- Ensemble Voting for final prediction  

## 🔎 Linguistic Features Analyzed

- Vocabulary uniqueness  
- Repetitive patterns  
- Sentiment consistency  
- Use of filler/extreme words  
- Formulaic phrases (e.g. "highly recommend", "excellent quality")  

## 🛠️ How to Run

Step 1: Install dependencies  
pip install -r requirements.txt  

Step 2: Set up environment variables  
Create a `.env` file using `.env.example` and add:  
APIFY_API_KEY=your_apify_token_here  
KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS=localhost:39092  

Step 3: Deploy Kafka services  
./deploy.sh up  

Step 4: Run the scraper and send reviews to Kafka  
python main.py --mode test --run-scraper  

Step 5: Train the model  
python main.py --mode train --dataset Data/Training_data/combined_dataset.csv  

Step 6: Evaluate or serve predictions  
python main.py --mode test  
python main.py --mode serve  

## 📊 Output Examples

- results/training/feature_importance_ieee.png – Top review features  
- results/training/roc_curves_ieee.png – ROC curves for all models  
- results/testing/test_results.csv – Label predictions and confidence  

## 🧪 Fake Review Detection Logic

The final prediction combines:  
- Statistical review features  
- NLP signals (sentiment, repetition, caps ratio)  
- Ensemble of ML classifiers  
- Threshold optimization to reduce false positives  

## 💡 Use Cases

- E-commerce fraud detection  
- Marketplace moderation tools  
- Academic research on generative content
